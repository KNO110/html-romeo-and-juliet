            <p><strong>PROLOGUE</strong></p>
            <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
               In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
               From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
               Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
               From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
               A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
               Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
               Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
               The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
               And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
               Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
               Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
               The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
               What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
